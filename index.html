    <h2 class="title is-4">Aims</h2>
    <p class="mb-2">
      The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers, with a focus on those early in their career, to share recent work on double categories and their applications to domains such as computer science, type theory, applied category theory, and higher category theory. The workshop will be open for everyone to attend online, with recordings of the talks being uploaded after the workshop is finished.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2">
      The workshop will hopefully be of interest to both those who are new to double categories and want to learn about the fundamental techniques and viewpoints, and also to domain specialists who are interested in technical results and current topics of active research. We also hope that this workshop will create a snapshot of the research area as it currently stands together with directions for future work, as well as provide an invitation to people wanting to know more about the area, or who are wondering if the tools or ideas in double category theory might be useful to their own research.
